This is an attempt to implementing FEATURES of sql in CLIENT side. 

However,Unlike SQLite, stlsql does not use sql (structured query language) or any other language for using it(querying). 

Stlsql developed(developing) using c++, especially with  stl, template meta programing, veridic template(planed for future) . Since sql is not involved here, no binding code is necessary to use it.


This project is in very early stage.
