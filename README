Do you want to create a database for your application? Is it little bit more complex to use good old struct and arrays?

Sql? Sqlite? -No way. Whose gona learn new language and do some crapy binding.


You can use c++ templates to emulate tables/views, primary key, foreign key or you can use  SQLSTL
